        <h2>Portfolio Overview</h2>
        <p>I was able to create the outline of my portfolio website through @Ade-mir's course, and I tailored down other parts to fit my preferred style. 
          This is my first website created using CSS, so it may be lacking at the moment, but I plan to gradually upload projects, experiences, and certifications in the future!</p>
